# Back Cover

> In a world of AI autopilot, this book teaches you how to take the wheel—by getting to the bottom of things, not just skimming the top.

AI does the work.
But do we still understand it?
Can we debug, adapt, build from scratch?
Or are we now just passengers?

I see it every day—
students lost in the basics.
Files? Configs? Crashes? Blank stares.

This book brings back the core skills.
Not anti-AI but pro-agency.
So if you want to
build with understanding, read this book.
