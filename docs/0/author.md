# About the Author

Tim Menzies (Ph.D. UNSW 1995, ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, ASE Fellow)
is a globally recognized leader in software engineering research,
best known for his pioneering work in data-driven, explainable, and
minimal AI for software systems. Over the past two decades, his
contributions have redefined defect prediction, effort estimation,
and multi-objective optimization, emphasizing transparency and
reproducibility. 

As the co-creator of the PROMISE repository, Tim helped establish
modern empirical software engineering, showing that small, interpretable
AI models can outperform larger, more complex ones. Currently, he
works as a full Professor in computer science at NC State, USA. He
is the director of the Irrational Research lab (mad scientists
r'us). His research has earned nearly $20 million in funding from
agencies such as NSF, DARPA, and NASA, as well as from private
companies like Meta, Microsoft and IBM. 

Tim has published over 300 papers, with more than 24,000 citations,
and advised 24 Ph.D. students. He is the editor-in-chief of the
editor-in-chief of the Automated Software Engineering journal and
an associate editor for IEEE TSE. His work continues to shape the
future of software engineering, focusing on creating AI tools that
are not only intelligent but also fair, transparent, and trustworthy.
